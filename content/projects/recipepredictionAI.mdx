### **Description**  
This project dives into the world of culinary AI by analyzing the extensive **Food.com** dataset containing 230K+ recipes and 1.1M+ user interactions. The primary goals were to predict recipe ratings based on textual and numerical data and to classify user preferences (ratings ≥ 4) with machine learning models. By bridging data science and AI, the project offers valuable insights into user behavior and personalized recommendations, creating potential applications for food platforms and recipe discovery.

### **My Role**  
As the lead developer of this project, I spearheaded the following:  

- **Machine Learning Pipeline**:  
  - Built a **rating prediction model** using **TF-IDF vectorization** of review text and Ridge regression to identify factors affecting user ratings.  
  - Developed a **Random Forest Classifier** for preference prediction, achieving a high F1 score of **0.96**, emphasizing user-specific features like ingredient alignment and average ratings.  

- **Data Engineering**:  
  - Preprocessed the **Food.com dataset**, transforming raw data into actionable features, such as ingredient vectors, user interaction histories, and review sentiments.  
  - Applied **Jaccard Similarity** for personalized recipe recommendations based on ingredient overlap.  

- **Feature Engineering**:  
  - Analyzed textual data (reviews, tags, and ingredients) and identified key terms influencing recipe ratings, such as “great” (positive) and “worst” (negative).  
  - Highlighted the impact of user-specific features like **average ratings** and **interaction history** on preference prediction.  

- **Visualization & Insights**:  
  - Created detailed visualizations, including correlation matrices and word clouds, to present actionable insights on rating trends and ingredient importance.  
  - Emphasized the limitations of numerical features, showcasing how textual data drives better predictions.

### **Features**  

- **Rating Prediction**:  
  - Predicted recipe ratings from review text with an MSE of **1.2823** using Ridge regression.  
  - Discovered significant textual patterns, with words like “thank” and “delicious” correlating strongly with higher ratings.  

- **User Preference Classification**:  
  - Developed a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a user would give a high rating (≥4).  
  - Integrated features like Jaccard similarity for ingredient alignment, average user ratings, and recipe interaction counts.  

- **Recommendation System**:  
  - Personalized recipe recommendations based on ingredient similarity, improving user engagement and discovery.

### **Development Highlights**  

- **Text Mining & TF-IDF**: Extracted meaningful features from textual data, transforming them into vectors to uncover latent patterns in user reviews.  
- **Multi-Model Approach**: Combined regression and classification techniques to explore different facets of the dataset, from numeric ratings to binary preferences.  
- **Data Visualization**: Highlighted trends and insights through interactive plots, showcasing ingredient popularity, rating distributions, and textual correlations.

### **Technologies**  

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Data Sources**: Food.com Dataset (Kaggle)  

---

### **Impact**  

- **Enhanced Personalization**: Provided insights into user behavior and personalized recipe recommendations.  
- **Practical Applications**: Demonstrated how textual and interaction data can predict user preferences and improve engagement for food platforms.  
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Validated the importance of review text and user-specific features, paving the way for more effective recommendation systems in the culinary domain.  

---

### **Future Plans**  

- Expand the analysis to include **sentiment analysis** for more nuanced rating predictions.  
- Integrate additional features, such as cuisine preferences and dietary needs, to improve recommendation diversity.  
- Deploy the models on a user-facing platform for real-world testing and validation.
