### **My Role**  
As the lead developer of StitchWitch, I was responsible for:  
- **AI Integration**: Applied prompt engineering to optimize three Google Gemini Pro AI agents for real-time surgical analysis:  
  1. **Observer-Agent**: Analyzed live video feeds and provided context in natural language.  
  2. **Procedure-Agent**: Maintained procedural history for surgical tracking.  
  3. **Alert-Agent**: Ensured adherence to medical protocols and alerted surgeons of potential risks.  
- **Computer Vision Implementation**: Integrated **OpenCV** to process live video streams and extract frames for real-time analysis.  
- **Full-Stack Development**: Built the application using the **Reflex** framework, enabling seamless integration of frontend and backend functionality.  
- **Pitching & Collaboration**: Pitched StitchWitch at **LA Hacks** to companies like Google, Intel, PSTC, and Fetch.ai, effectively communicating its potential impact in healthcare.

### **Features**  
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Live surgical monitoring to detect errors and provide immediate feedback.  
- **Multi-Agent AI System**: Utilized distinct AI agents for observing, documenting, and validating surgical procedures.  
- **Simulated Surgical Streams**: Tested the system using simulated surgical live streams due to hardware constraints.  

---

### **Development Highlights**  
- **Generative AI**: Leveraged Google Gemini Pro's multimodal capabilities to address complex medical challenges.  
- **Computer Vision**: Utilized OpenCV for efficient real-time video analysis.  
- **Full-Stack Framework**: Streamlined development with Reflex, allowing robust frontend and backend workflows using Python.
